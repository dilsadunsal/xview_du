# Imagery and Label Extraction from xView Dataset
This repository includes a Colab notebook designed for extracting images and their corresponding labels belonging to a specific class from the [xView dataset.](http://xviewdataset.org/)  (Aircraft extraction was performed to provide an example) 

This initial notebook also provides code for converting labels from the geojson format into YOLO.txt format, making the labels readily usable for YOLO experiments. 

The notebook begins with mounting Google Drive, and thereafter, each code snippet is prepared for testing with cloud-based data.

Those who are interested can also use the map in the [link]([http://xviewdataset.org/](https://dilsadunsal.github.io/xview_du/)) to see the distribution of images from which samples of the Xview dataset are taken.
